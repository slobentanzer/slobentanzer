### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a research software engineer working on open-source repositories for biomedical science. You can find some of my projects below.

I am an advocate for open science and interested in molecular causality. My background is in neuropharmacology, but I have since then branched into software engineering, machine learning, and statistics; my research focus are Knowledge Representation and Large Language Models. If you're interested in what I do, or want to contribute, don't hesitate to reach out to me. My contact information can also be found on my [web page](https://slobentanzer.github.io).
